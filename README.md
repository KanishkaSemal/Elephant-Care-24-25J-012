  ## üåç Elephant-Care: Wearable IoT ‚Äì Enabled Belt for Elephant protection & Emergency identification (24-25J-012)**

  
  üêò Overview
  
<p>Elephants are endangered and play a vital role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystems. 
However, they frequently face significant threats from human activities, particularly collisions 
with trains. In India alone, approximately 150 elephants are killed annually due to such accidents 
(Gamage & Wijesundara, 2014).[1] These collisions not only diminish elephant populations but 
also pose severe risks to human safety and result in substantial economic losses due to property 
damage. To address this critical issue, implementing effective solutions like Elephant-Care is 
essential. Elephant-Care aims to leverage IoT technology to create a safer environment for both 
elephants and humans by preventing collisions through advanced detection, monitoring, and 
alert systems. This innovative approach integrates data transmission systems, biometric storage, 
data analysis, and an effective user interface to monitor elephant movements and predict 
potential collision hotspots. By utilizing a combination of real-time data collection, machine 
learning algorithms, and seamless communication networks, Elephant-Care can provide timely 
alerts to authorities, enabling preventive measures and promoting coexistence. And our system 
can detect detailed behavioral differences in elephants, such as distinguishing between lying 
down and walking. This capability allows for more accurate monitoring and tailored interventions. 
Overall, this multidisciplinary strategy offers a promising solution to a pressing conservation 
challenge, significantly reducing the incidence of collisions and supporting both wildlife 
conservation and human safety efforts.</p>
